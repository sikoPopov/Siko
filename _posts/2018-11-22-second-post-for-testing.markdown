I have Error 408 on Polydoros 80S. I checked filaments of the tube(OPTI 150/40/80 HC) and found defective filament(Large Focus) I made a jumper between two pins of the high voltage cathode (-) cable(between Common and Large focus) and I hadn't error 408. I change to Small focus and when I try to make exposure - I have very long exposure(even in low mAS), but haven't x-rays.... and no error code

P.S. I changed these tube year ago(second hand) and calibrated both focuses completely...
